# DataViz_Assessment1

## Description

This repository contains the first assessment for our **CSELEC3C - Data Analysis and Visualization** course. It involves analyzing two datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and FAOSTAT, focusing on global agricultural production and food statistics. The developers used Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, PyCountry, and Plotly.

## Key Features

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and merged the `FAO` and `FAOSTAT` datasets, and created new features to enhance the analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Provided summary statistics and identified key patterns through correlation matrix, heatmap visualization, and group-based analysis.
- **Visualization:** Created time series and comparison plots to highlight trends. Additionally, a choropleth map was created for geographical visualization.
- **Conclusions & Recommendations:** Summarized the findings and suggested practical recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders based on the data.
